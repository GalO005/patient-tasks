# Changes Made

## Implementation Changes

1. **New Department-based Request Service**

   - Implemented `DepartmentPatientRequestService` to support grouping tasks by both patient ID and department
   - Added two-level grouping using nested defaultdict for efficient task organization
   - Introduced department-specific request management logic

2. **Request Management Logic**

   - Added support for multiple open requests per patient (one per department)
   - Implemented department transition handling
   - Added cleanup logic for departments with no remaining open tasks

3. **Code Structure Improvements**

   - Split large methods into smaller, focused functions
   - Added proper type hints throughout the code
   - Improved error handling for edge cases
   - Added comprehensive docstrings in Google style

4. **Quality Assurance**
   - Added Ruff for code quality enforcement
   - Configured pyproject.toml with strict linting rules
   - Standardized code formatting across the project
   - Added type checking and documentation requirements

## Design Rationale

1. **Two-Level Grouping Structure**

   - Used nested defaultdict for efficient grouping of tasks first by patient, then by department
   - This structure makes it natural to process all departments for a patient at once
   - Helps maintain data consistency when handling department transitions

2. **Request Lifecycle Management**

   - Maintains separate requests per department to allow independent tracking
   - Automatically closes requests when all tasks in a department are closed or moved
   - Preserves medical history by keeping closed requests intact

3. **Code Organization**

   - Separated concerns into distinct methods for better maintainability
   - Improved method signatures with proper type hints
   - Added clear documentation for future maintenance
   - Reduced complexity in the main update logic

4. **Database Interaction**
   - Minimized database operations by batching updates per patient/department
   - Used TinyDB's query capabilities for efficient request lookups
   - Improved error handling for database operations

## Trade-offs and Assumptions

1. **Memory vs. Database Operations**

   - Chose to load all open requests for a patient at once
   - Trade-off: Higher memory usage vs. fewer database queries
   - Assumption: Number of open requests per patient is manageable

2. **Data Structure Choices**

   - Used dictionaries for O(1) lookups of existing requests by department
   - Trade-off: Additional memory usage vs. faster processing
   - Assumption: Department list is small and finite

3. **Request Closure Handling**

   - Automatically close requests when departments no longer have open tasks
   - Trade-off: Might need additional logic if request history needs to be preserved differently
   - Assumption: Closed requests should be retained as medical history

4. **Code Quality vs. Performance**
   - Added strict typing and documentation requirements
   - Trade-off: More verbose code vs. better maintainability
   - Assumption: Development time is more valuable than minor performance gains

## Potential Future Improvements

1. **Performance Optimizations**

   - Could add caching for frequently accessed requests
   - Could implement batch updates for better database performance
   - Could add indexes on patient_id and status fields

2. **Additional Features**

   - Could add department transition history tracking
   - Could implement department-specific business rules
   - Could add department load balancing metrics

3. **Monitoring and Debugging**

   - Could add logging for department transitions
   - Could track request lifecycle metrics
   - Could add department-specific performance metrics

4. **Code Quality**
   - Could add more automated tests
   - Could implement pre-commit hooks for Ruff
   - Could add runtime validation for department values
